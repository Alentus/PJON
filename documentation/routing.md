## Routing
Transparent routing based on a tree topology has been implemented by Fred Larsen with the `PJONSimpleSwitch`, `PJONSwitch`, `PJONRouter`, `PJONDynamicRouter` and `PJONInteractiveRouter`. Those classes implement the following router roles:

### SimpleSwitch
[SimpleSwitch](/examples/ARDUINO/Local/SoftwareBitBang/Switch/SimpleSwitch) connects two buses using the same strategy (`SoftwareBitBang` <=> `SoftwareBitBang`) primarily used to amplify signals and so extend the maximum range. It is useful instead of `PJONSwitch` to save memory when the same strategy is used in all buses. It avoids virtual inheritance so it is faster and has a smaller footprint.
```cpp
 __________             ________              __________
|          | SWBB bus  |        | SWBB bus   |          |
| DEVICE 1 |___________| SWITCH |____________| DEVICE 2 |
|__________|           |________|            |__________|
```
The `SimpleSwitch` class provides with configurable transparent packet switching between buses using the same strategy. `SimpleSwitch` requires a tree topology (it does not contain any loop detection procedure). The `SimpleSwitch` class receives as a parameter the length and the array of 2 or more `PJONBus` instances:
```cpp
/* In both cases the switch does not have an assigned id it is
   transparently switching packets in both directions */
PJONBus<SoftwareBitBang> bus1(PJON_NOT_ASSIGNED);
PJONBus<SoftwareBitBang> bus2(PJON_NOT_ASSIGNED);
```
Optionally polling time can be configured:
```cpp
PJONBus<SoftwareBitBang> bus2(
  PJON_NOT_ASSIGNED, // Switch device id
  1000               // Polling time in microseconds
);
```
Optionally device id ranges can be statically configured:
```cpp
PJONBus<SoftwareBitBang> bus2(
  PJON_NOT_ASSIGNED, // Switch device id
  1000,              // Polling time in microseconds
  2,                 // 2 ranges present (1-127, 128-254)
  0,                 // range 1 in use here (1-127)
);
```
After the `PJONBus` definitions, a `PJONSimpleSwitch` instance can be created:
```cpp
// PJONSimpleSwitch definition:
PJONSimpleSwitch<SoftwareBitBang> router(
  2, // Length of the bus array
  (PJONBus<SoftwareBitBang>*[2]){&bus1,&bus2} // Bus array
);
```
Can be optionally defined a default gateway:
```cpp
PJONSimpleSwitch<SoftwareBitBang> router(
  2, // Length of the bus array
  (PJONBus<SoftwareBitBang>*[2]){&bus1,&bus2}, // Bus array
  122 // Statically defined default gateway device id
);
```
Then configure each strategy and the `router` instance as required:
```cpp

void setup() {
  // Set each SoftwareBitBang bus pin connection
  bus1.strategy.set_pin(7);
  bus2.strategy.set_pin(12);
  router.begin();
}
```
Then call the `loop` function as often as possible to achieve optimal performance:
```cpp

void loop() {
  router.loop();
};
```

### Switch
[Switch](/examples/ARDUINO/Local/SoftwareBitBang/Switch/Switch) routes packets between locally attached buses also if different strategies or media are in use. It supports a default gateway to be able to act as a leaf in a larger network setup. Thanks to the `PJONSwitch` class, with few lines of code, a switch that operates multiple strategies can be created:
```cpp
/* Connect SoftwareBitBang bus with an AnalogSampling bus:

 _______     WIRED       ______    WIRELESS    _______
|       |SoftwareBitBang|      |AnalogSampling|       |
|DEVICE1|_______________|SWITCH| _ _ _ _ _ _ _|DEVICE2|
|_______|BUS ID 0.0.0.1 |______|BUS ID 0.0.0.2|_______|

See below */

StrategyLink<SoftwareBitBang> link1;
StrategyLink<AnalogSampling> link2;

PJONAny bus1(&link1, (uint8_t[4]){0,0,0,1});
PJONAny bus2(&link2, (uint8_t[4]){0,0,0,2});

PJONSwitch router(2, (PJONAny*[2]){&bus1, &bus2});

```
Then configure each strategy and the `router` instance as required:
```cpp
void setup() {
  // Tell SoftwareBitBang which pin is used
  link1.strategy.set_pin(12);
  // Tell AnalogSampling which pin is used
  link2.strategy.set_pin(A0);
  // Start router operation
  router.begin();
}
```
Then call the `loop` function as often as possible to achieve optimal performance:
```cpp
void loop() {
  // Execute router operation
  router.loop();
}
```
### Router
[Router](/examples/ARDUINO/Network/SoftwareBitBang/Router) routes between locally attached buses also if different strategies or media are in use, and remote buses reachable through the locally attached buses.
```cpp
                 ________
    Bus 0.0.0.3 |        | Bus 0.0.0.4
________________| ROUTER |________________
      |         |________|         |
      |                            |
      | Bus 0.0.0.1    Bus 0.0.0.2 |
 _____|____                   _____|____
|          |                 |          |
| DEVICE 1 |                 | DEVICE 2 |
|__________|                 |__________|
```

### DynamicRouter
[Dynamic router](/examples/ARDUINO/Network/SoftwareBitBang/Router/DynamicRouter) is a router that also populates a routing table of remote (not directly attached) buses observing traffic.

### Virtual bus
[Virtual bus](/examples/ARDUINO/Local/SoftwareBitBang/Tunneler) is a bus where multiple buses using potentially different media or strategies, connected through a router, have the same bus id (including the local bus case), and where the location of each device is automatically registered observing traffic.

### Interactive router
[Interactive router](/examples/ARDUINO/Network/SoftwareBitBang/Switch/BlinkingSwitch) routes packets as a switch or router but it is also able to act as a device and have user-defined receive and error call-back.
